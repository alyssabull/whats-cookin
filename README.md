## Overview

In this project, we've created a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and see which ingredients they are missing. Users should be able to view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook, and view the ingredients that they need based off of their chosen recipe.

## Project Goals

* Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

## Functionality

#### Home Page

* When the user loads the page, a home page is displayed that features an 'All Recipes' section as well as a search section. The 'All Recipes' section shows a list of recipes that a user may view and add to their favorites or recipes to cook if they desire. The search section allows a user to filter recipes by category or ingredient.
