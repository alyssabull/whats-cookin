## Overview

* In this project, we've created a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and see which ingredients they are missing. Users should be able to view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook, and view the ingredients that they need based off of their chosen recipe.

## Project Goals

* Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

## Functionality

#### Home Page

* When the user loads the page, a home page is displayed that features an 'All Recipes' section as well as a search section. The 'All Recipes' section shows a list of recipes that a user may view and add to their favorites or recipes to cook if they desire. The search section allows a user to filter recipes by category or ingredient.

#### Navigation Bar

* The navigation bar at the top of the page can be used to navigate through the different pages, such as the home page, a user's favorites, a user's recipes to cook, and a user's pantry.
* There is also a 'User' button that when clicked will assign a new user and a new pantry associated with that user.

#### Searching For Recipes

* The search section appears on the left hand side of the screen when the user is on the home page, favorite recipes page, or the recipes to cook page.
* The search results will change based on the page the user is on

#### Recipe Page

* When a user clicks on a recipe, they are taken to that recipe's page.  They then can view the ingredients and instructions required for the recipe.
* A user can also click a 'Check Pantry Stock' button (described below)

#### Checking Pantry Stock

* After a recipe is selected, the user has the option to 'Check Pantry Stock'.  This will tell them which ingredients they are missing and how much of that ingredient they need.

#### Favorited Recipes Page

* After a user has favorited some recipes, they may click the 'Favorites' button on the NAV to take them to their favorited recipes.

#### Recipes To Cook Page

* After a user has selected some recipes to cook, they may click the 'Recipes To Cook' button on the NAV to take them to their recipes to cook.

#### User Pantry

* A user can click on the 'Pantry' button on the NAV to view all of their ingredients, along with the amount that they have.

#### Wins 
* Creating class structure and corresponding tests from scratch
* Using correct array iterator methods when needed
* Connecting our Class JS files to our main JS file
* Consistent Git workflow
* Solid collaboration methods

#### Challenges
* Writing useful sad path tests
* Having Class methods be useful/accurate before DOM manipulation
* Focusing on data model first
* Refactoring code right after itâ€™s written (instead of waiting to do it later)
